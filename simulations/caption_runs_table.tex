Parameters of the simulation: the coupling $g$, the temporal $(T)$ and spacial $(L)$ extent of the lattice and the line of constant physics fixed by $LM$. The size of the statistics after thermalization is given in the last column in terms of molecular dynamic units (MDU) which equals an HMC trajectory of length one. The number of replica collected for each set of parameters is stated in the column named R. The auto-correlation times $\tau$ of our main observables $m_{x}$ and $S$ are also given in MDU together with the Q-value of the replica in parenthesis. \label{tab: runs_param}
