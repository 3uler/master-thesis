\chapter{Simulations and observables}
In this chapter we will present some basic information on the implementation of the previously discussed algorithm and state the utilized parameters of the conducted simulations. Furthermore we need to discuss how to take the continuum limit of the observables of interest.

\section{Implementation and simulation parameters}
The executables for the Monte Carlo simulation are built from an implementation in the \names{Fortran 95} standard and compiled with an $\text{Intel}^{\circledR}$ \texttt{ifort} compiler\footnote{From the $\text{Intel}^{\circledR}$ Parallel Studio XE 2015.}.
